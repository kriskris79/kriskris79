Hi There 👋 I’m Kris, and I'm living in the UK.

- 👀 I’m studying IT at the Open University and am always open to learning something new. I really enjoy creating an application in React, especially using JavaScript.
- 💻 Check out [My Personal Website](https://www.blackandwhitedev.com) to learn more about my projects and skills.
